# Supa-Charging: Optimal EV Charging Planner

Winner of the KONVERTO challenge at NOI Hackathon Summer Edition 2023

## About

Supa-Charging is an intelligent EV charging planner developed during the NOI Hackathon Summer Edition 2023, a 24-hour event that challenges participants to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. Our team, Supa-Charging, tackled the KONVERTO challenge, which focused on optimizing electric vehicle charging experiences.

The goal of Supa-Charging is to simplify and enhance the EV charging process for users. By considering factors such as destination, appointment duration, current battery level, and desired final charge, our app recommends the most suitable charging station. This ensures that users can efficiently charge their vehicles while attending to their daily activities, eliminating range anxiety and maximizing convenience.

Our solution stood out for its smooth user experience, featuring intuitive list and map views, quick setting modals, and integration with Google Maps for location services and travel time estimation. We also introduced an innovative feature allowing users to upload their personal charging stations, promoting a sharing economy in the EV charging space.
